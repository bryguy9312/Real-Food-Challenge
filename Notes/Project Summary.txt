Here is an outline of what this visualization needs to do and how I'm planning on implementing these features.

1) We need to calculate the "Real Food Percentage" (RFP) which is the amount a school spends on real food out of the total cost of food
    The data given includes no information about schools so I'm not sure how we're supposed to get that information
    The data given only includes information about retailers, we should email Emma and ask if she has data on individual school for us or not

    The way I'm thinking of approaching this is with bar graphs, ideally we'll be able to get our hands on data specific to several schools and display each school's RFP on one chart
        then open a new bar graph with percentages relating to each category when a user clicks on an individual school's bar

2) She also said she wanted a breakdown of the RFP for each of the 4 RFP criteria: local, fair, ecological, humane
    we could either display this data on the same bar graph or a separate one

3) once the data vis is complete, she's asked for some interactivity from the user. Namely, the ability to change the RFP for certain categories and see how that affects the overall RFP
    this might not be a 100% correct interpretation but that's what I got out of what she said
    Sliders could be good here, or text inputs, maybe we should use angular along with d3 if possible

4) finally, she's asked for a way to display real food alternatives to the user, these are in the second csv file
    I don't really have any ideas on this yet, and I think this should be one of the last things we worry about


Overall: I think this is definitely doable, and the plan I have right now is completely adaptable so feel free to pitch your own ideas.

    Right now we should all focus on learning d3, I'll probably convert the csv files to JSON so we can actually access the data.



    Here is a very basic Bar Graph example, very easy to code and with some modifications would be great for at least the overall school comparison

    also, pie charts might be a great way to display the data for an individual school

Stephen's Notes:

I think the data given to us is the school data too - showing what a school purchases. The way I envisioned this project was having several tabs (surprisingly easy with bootstrap)
so that we could switch between various views, and then categories that could be selected. So for example: one view would show all the food categories and then upon clicking each
button, you could see more specifics, such as what exactly is in the category, etc. I have a collection of really nice icons that could go with this (or anything really).

JSON Import with D3:
d3.json("temp.json", function(error, data){
    //Asynchronous function, all manipulation should occur in here.
});

JSON Notes:
    Importing the JSON file puts the data into an array of objects (http://i.imgur.com/0tQqu89.png).
