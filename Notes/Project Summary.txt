Here is an outline of what this visualization needs to do and how I'm planning on implementing these features.

1) We need to calculate the "Real Food Percentage" (RFP) which is the amount a school spends on real food out of the total cost of food
    The data given includes no information about schools so I'm not sure how we're supposed to get that information
    The data given only includes information about retailers, we should email Emma and ask if she has data on individual school for us or not

    The way I'm thinking of approaching this is with bar graphs, ideally we'll be able to get our hands on data specific to several schools and display each school's RFP on one chart
        then open a new bar graph with percentages relating to each category when a user clicks on an individual school's bar

2) She also said she wanted a breakdown of the RFP for each of the 4 RFP criteria: local, fair, ecological, humane
    we could either display this data on the same bar graph or a separate one

3) once the data vis is complete, she's asked for some interactivity from the user. Namely, the ability to change the RFP for certain categories and see how that affects the overall RFP
    this might not be a 100% correct interpretation but that's what I got out of what she said
    Sliders could be good here, or text inputs, maybe we should use angular along with d3 if possible

4) finally, she's asked for a way to display real food alternatives to the user, these are in the second csv file
    I don't really have any ideas on this yet, and I think this should be one of the last things we worry about


Overall: I think this is definitely doable, and the plan I have right now is completely adaptable so feel free to pitch your own ideas.

    Right now we should all focus on learning d3, I'll probably convert the csv files to JSON so we can actually access the data.



    Here is a very basic Bar Graph example, very easy to code and with some modifications would be great for at least the overall school comparison

    also, pie charts might be a great way to display the data for an individual school

Stephen's Notes:

I think the data given to us is the school data too - showing what a school purchases. The way I envisioned this project was having several tabs (surprisingly easy with bootstrap)
so that we could switch between various views, and then categories that could be selected. So for example: one view would show all the food categories and then upon clicking each
button, you could see more specifics, such as what exactly is in the category, etc. I have a collection of really nice icons that could go with this (or anything really).

JSON Import with D3:
d3.json("temp.json", function(error, data){
    //Asynchronous function, all manipulation should occur in here.
});

JSON Notes:
    Importing the JSON file puts the data into an array of objects (http://i.imgur.com/0tQqu89.png).

BIND DATA::

array of objects

each object will look like this:

{
    'category': 'baked',
    'fakeFood': 32225,
    'realFood': 391,
    'totalFood': 32616,
    'ecological': 391.68,
    'fair': 0,
    'humane': 0,
    'local': 0,
    'total': 391.68,
    'items': {{array of items}} // not really sure about this one, it really depends on how we want to display the items, but we'll probably also need to include the items from alternatives as well
}

actually, I'll need ecological, fair, etc in its own array and then inside of that array will be items and alternatives, this way I can pass the array as a setting to create a new View and BarGraph...
Look at the test data I used in View, that is exactly what I need with the addition of the array of items if we are going to use them (which I think we should)


TODO: (BRYAN)
    after data is formatted, I need to adjust code for ajax calls
    Need to fix x axis still (will probably remove the ticks and just use labels or whatever it's called in d3)
    Need to adjust width of individual rectangles, width should be proportional to chart size and how many rects there are
    Need to clear the #svg2 html whenever a bar in #svg1 is clicked (also, need to initialize with total data instead of baked goods)
        this code will probably need further adjustment based on what eric is going to do
    Code needs to be cleaned up in general... it is very messy and I don't like it (Mine, Stephen's is awesome)

TODO: (Steven)
    Please format the data as specified above, that's really all we need to get this working for the entire data set
    Probably remove the json stuff from main.js, I don't think it's actually being used now that we are calling for data in View instead
    Adjusting the ajax to use d3.csv() instead of json would be very nice

TODO: (General)
    we should probably remove debug stuff before sending it to emma
    we need to implement some basic user controls if possible
    I'd really like to display the items in a category when it is clicked on in the second graph, along with the relevant alternatives she provided
    Eric needs to do the styling and stuff, not sure what he's done so far or what
