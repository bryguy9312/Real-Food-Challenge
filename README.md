# Real-Food-Challenge

Real Food Challenge is a national student campaign dedicated to creating a healthy, just and sustainable food system. Our goal is the shift $1 billion in institutional food spending to ‘real food.’

We define real food as food that fulfills at least one of four categories:

1) Local and Community-Based: These foods can be traced to nearby farms and businesses that are locally owned and operated. Sourcing these foods supports the local economy by keeping money in the community and builds community relations. The food travels fewer miles to reach consumers. The food is seasonal,and when it is fresh, it often has a higher nutrient content.
2) Fair: Individuals involved in food production, distribution, preparation--and other parts of the food system—work in safe and fair conditions; receive a living wage;are ensured the right to organize and the right to a grievance process; and have equal opportunity for employment. Fair food builds community capacity and ensures and promotes socially just practices in the food system.
3) Ecologically Sound: Farms, businesses, and other operations involved with food production practice environmental stewardship that conserves biodiversity and preserves natural resources, including energy, wildlife, water, air, and soil. Production practices should minimize toxic substances as well as direct and indirect petroleum inputs.
4) Humane: Animals can express natural behavior in a low-stress environment and are raised with no hormones or unnecessary medication.
